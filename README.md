# InImNet
Repository with sample code to support the paper 'Imbedding Deep Neural Networks' [[OpenReview]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yKIAXjkJc2F).

We include a selection of notebooks to support the results in the paper. These are implemented in Tensorflow using Google Colab. We also include a PyTorch implementation, [inimsolve](inimsolve), in development.
